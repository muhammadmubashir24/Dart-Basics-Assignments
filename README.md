## Assignment Questions and Solutions

Each question is implemented in the `main.dart` file with clear labeling.

1. **Total Marks and Percentage**  
   Take 4 integer variables for subjects. Print the user's total marks and percentage using string concatenation.

2. **Temperature Conversion**  
   Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formulas:  
   - °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32  
   - °C = (°F − 32) × 5/9

3. **Area of Rectangle**  
   Length and breadth of a rectangle are 5 and 7 respectively. Calculate the area using:  
   `Area = length × breadth`

4. **Math Operations**  
   Create an integer variable `num = 7`. Add 8, divide the result by 3 (truncating division), take modulus 5, then multiply by 5. Store in `i` and display.

5. **Logical Conditions**  
   Create two integers `a` and `b`. Check if both `a < 50` and `a < b` are true, and also if at least one condition is true.

6. **Robert's Marks**  
   Given marks in three subjects (78, 45, 62), calculate total marks and percentage. Print the name, individual marks, total, and percentage.

7. **Swap Two Integers**  
   Swap the values of two integers using a temporary variable.

8. **Average of Five Integers**  
   Calculate the average of five given integers.

9. **Maximum of Three Numbers**  
   Find the maximum among three numbers using ternary operators or simple math logic.

10. **Simple Interest Calculation**  
    Calculate simple interest using:  
    `SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100`

11. **Square and Cube**  
    Calculate the square and cube of a given number.

12. **Convert Minutes to Hours and Minutes**  
    Convert total minutes (e.g., 130) into hours and remaining minutes.

13. **Perimeter (Circumference) of a Circle**  
    Calculate the perimeter using:  
    `Perimeter = 2 × π × radius`  
    (Uses `dart:math` for π)

14. **Sum of Digits of a 3-digit Number**  
    Take a 3-digit number and calculate the sum of its individual digits.

15. **Convert Days to Weeks and Days**  
    Convert a given number of days (e.g., 17) into weeks and remaining days.
